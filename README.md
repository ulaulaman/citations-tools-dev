## Link doi

Using the standard for doi link, the plugin introduce a shortcode in order to create a link to a paper provided by doi.
**How to use the shortcode**:

[ctdoi code="..."]Title of the paper[/doi]

## Doi resolver

The plugin send the doi code to [Crossref Metadata Search](https://search.crossref.org/), get the information and publish a full citation in apa standard with the shortcode [ctdoiresolve ...].
**How to use the shortcode**:

[ctdoiresolve code="..."]

There are also three optional parameters:

[ctdoiresolve code="..." arxiv="..."]

if the paper has an arXiv version

[ctdoiresolve code="..." pdfurl="..."]

if the paper has a free pdf version

[ctdoiresolve code="..." archiveurl="..."]

if the paper has a free version on [archive.org](https://archive.org/)

## Manual citations

There's also a shortcode for manual citations, [paperdata ...]. You can use it with the following syntax:

[paperdata auth="author/s name/s" year="..." title="..." journal="..." vol="..." issue="..." pages="..." code="..."]

You can also use the arxiv, pdfurl, archiveurl parameters.

## Styling

You can style citations adding in your css theme the class "paperdata".

## External service

**Digital Object Identifier**, or *DOI*, is a persistent identifier used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the **International Organization for Standardization** (*ISO*). DOIs are mainly used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, official publications.

***Citations tools*** uses the [CrossRef Metadata API](http://search.crossref.org/help/api) to retrieve complete publication information using the doi code as a search query. CrossRef is a part of the [doi system](https://dx.doi.org/).
